I"…<p>Just another human mesmerised by the beauty of the universe and embarking on a journey to understand it.
 â€œWe evolved a body to experience the world and a mind to make sense of itâ€ - Me and probably many others. 
 Like the previous sentence, the content of this website represents my own evolving view of the world with the unavoidable biases due to my physical incarnation and past experiences. Though, I will endeavour to build any argument logically from well stated assumptions. 
 I wish this journey to be rich in surpises and encounters. Follow me and message me on <a href="https://twitter.com/RGuiazon">twitter</a> @RGuiazon.</p>
